                                    Goodbye & Good Riddance is the debut studio album by American rapper and singer Juice Wrld. It was released on May 25, 2018, by Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. Production was primarily handled by Nick Mira alongside several other record producers, including Benny Blanco, Cardo, CBMix, Don Rob, Dre Moon, Ghost Loft, and Mitch Mula. It features a sole guest appearance from fellow American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. On May 28, 2021, the album was re-released to commemorate its third anniversary; the re-release includes a new song titled "734" as well as a remix of "Lucid Dreams" featuring Lil Uzi Vert (retaining his status as the sole feature), while excluding the single "Armed and Dangerous", which was featured on the December 10, 2018 Spotify and Tidal reissue of the album. The album was re-released for its 5th anniversary on May 18, 2023, which included 2 new songs, those being "No Good" and "Glo'd Up". Goodbye & Good Riddance debuted at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 with 39,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. In its second week, the album moved up to number eight with an additional 45,000 units.[19] In its third week, the album climbed the chart to number six with 42,000 album-equivalent units. As of March 2019, Goodbye & Good Riddance has earned a million album-equivalent units in the United States. On May 23, 2023, the album was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over five million units.

Sting owns 85% of the rights to "Lucid Dreams" after a legal battle with Juice and his team. This song also led to another lawsuit posthomous in October 2019, where members of then-defunct pop punk band Yellowcard sued Juice WRLD for $15 million claiming that the song copied the melody of their song "Holly Wood Died". It was quietly droppped on July 27, 2020.</li>
